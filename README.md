## First VueJS Project - Adobe Color Picker

This project is my first venture into Vue.js development and is inspired by the Adobe Color Picker landing page. While it is primarily a copy of the Adobe Color Picker landing page, I have added some functionality to make it more interactive. The main purpose of this project is to practice Vue.js development.

### Features

- **Draggable Plates**: You can drag and rearrange color plates to customize your palette.
- **Color Wheel**: I used the iro library to implement a color wheel for selecting and customizing colors.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The project includes media queries for a mobile view, ensuring a responsive user experience.
